# WiDS Datathon Global Challenge

## Project Overview

This repository contains my submission for the Women in Data Science (WiDS) Datathon Global Challenge. The competition, organized in collaboration with Ann S. Bowers Womenâ€™s Brain Health Initiative (WBHI), Cornell University, and UC Santa Barbara, focuses on neuropsychiatric disorders that impact adolescents, including ADHD, anxiety, depression, and autism.

## Problem Statement

Neuropsychiatric disorders present differently in males and females, with conditions like ADHD often going undiagnosed in girls. This project aims to build predictive models that better identify these conditions, reducing the gap in diagnosis and treatment.

## Dataset

The dataset for this competition is provided by the Healthy Brain Network (HBN) and the Reproducible Brain Charts project (RBC). It includes detailed neurodevelopmental data collected to support better understanding of neuropsychiatric disorders.

## Approach

### Data Exploration and Cleaning: 
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution, handled missing values, and addressed any anomalies.

### Feature Engineering: 
Created new features based on Graph theory for brain network analysis used sheafer atlas. Analysized intra and inter network connectivity. Apply PCA method for dimention reduction. (using networkx package)

### Model Development:
Built and optimized multiple machine learning models, including ensemble models, to ensure robust predictions.(using sikit-learn, XGboost and other ML libraries)

### Evaluation: 
Assessed model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
